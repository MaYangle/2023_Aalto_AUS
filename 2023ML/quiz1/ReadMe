The answers of the file 1 are
1. Regression,Binary classification,Ranking, Multi-lable classificatiom
2. a
3. b
4. a calculated by the quiz1_template.py
5. We both think d is right, Recall is the best evaluation metric, SVM performs better than LR. However the answer is wrong
Maybe b is right, because this question focus on the malignant disease. So Recall is more important

I understand the last one now. Suppose we catch the fish. The whole lake has 100 fish.
The bigger net: we catch 80 fish and 80 rocks. Recall: 80%    Precision:50%
The smaller net: we only catch 20 fish   Recall: 20%   Precision: 100%
Maybe the precision is more important to decide the cancer.
