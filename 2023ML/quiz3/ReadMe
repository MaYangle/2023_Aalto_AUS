1. 0.2917 you can find how i calculate in quiz3-1.py
2. b In lecture5 you can see the percepton algorithm will stop after at most t <= (2R/y).^2  
Y means the largest achievable geometric margin so that all training examples have at least that margin 
R means the small radius of the d-dimensional ball that encloses the training data  
Y more, R less ,more easier to converage , so the noramlization doesn't affect the iterations
